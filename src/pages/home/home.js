                Hello everyone, Ajai Singh, Founder and Chief Mentor of Toil Chamber of Mathematics Pvt. Ltd. (TCM
                EDUCATION), Indiaâ€™s fasted growing institute for CAT, CLAT, IPMAT & CUET
                exams. Being a mentor and teacher to young minds is the most fulfilling identity I have ever known. It is
                an honor to guide and inspire the next generation, and nothing compares to the joy of watching students
                grow into their full potential. Teaching has always been my first love, right from my childhood. I hail
                from a business family, so joining it should have been an obvious choice. Then my knack for numbers
                and aptitude landed me into several corporate and Government jobs with minimum effort. In my last
                job, with Indian Railways, I realized that knowledge beseeches dissemination and the Goddess of
                wisdom smiles upon those who spread the light of it.
                For the past twenty years, I have had the honor of leading the vanguard and serving as an influence and
                inspiration to achieve stellar results year after year in CAT, CLAT, and IPMAT. The Chamber Of
                Mathematics started as a small venture with a big vision of transforming the phobia of maths into a mania. My students are the living testimonials of the difference I am making in the lives and careers of
                ignited minds. I have the esteemed privilege of creating employment opportunities for catalysts of change-our
                esteemed educators-in diverse realms of aptitude.
